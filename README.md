## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sarah. 

I develop open-source geospatial tools. I'm passionate about building scalable, efficient, and accessible solutions that enable geospatial data to address previously insurmountable questions in climate, forestry, and beyond.

I'm most experienced with Python but am actively learning Rust and Julia, along with their related geospatial ecosystems, in pursuit of becoming a [language-agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-agnostic) developer.
