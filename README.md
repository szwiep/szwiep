## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sarah. 

I develop geospatial tools (often open-source). I'm passionate about building scalable, efficient, and accessible solutions that enable geospatial data to address previously insurmountable questions in climate, forestry, and beyond.

I primarily work with Python but am in favour of [language-agnostic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-agnostic) development. Actively learning Rust and Julia along with their geospatial ecosystems.
